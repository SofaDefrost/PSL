Python Scene Language for Sofa
==============================

The Python Scene Language (PSL) project is an attempt to mix the advantages of *scn* and *pyscn* in an
unified framework. 

The first release of PSL is now in the V1 branch. 
We are currently designing V2. 

The main branch is thus expected non functionnal and experimental.
