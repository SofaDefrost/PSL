Python Scene Languages for Sofa
===============================

The Python Scene Languages (PSL) project study the different way by which scene can be described in SOFA. 

The first release of PSL is now in the V1 branch and contains a first version of PSL for python, json and xml. 
We are currently designing V2. 

The main branch is thus expected non functionnal and experimental.  
Please make pull requests to submit ideas you want to discus in the *pep* directory.
